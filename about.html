    <h1 class="walloftext">
      &emsp; I was born in Texas in April of 2003, though I don't remember much before I moved to Florida. Some of my
      earliest memories include watching my siblings play video games such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and
      cheering them on whenever they got past a tough section. From making Miis with my family and babysitter to even
      getting to try the games out myself sometimes, these early memories show how my love for video games was born
      during this time period.
      <br />
      <br />&emsp; In seventh grade, I joined the middle school band as a clarinet player. Aside from slamming random
      keys on a piano and giggling at the funny noises, this was my first experience with a musical instrument. I
      learned the essential skill of practice, and I learned how to work with a team to make something greater than the
      individual. I also got my first digital piano this year, and I made some of my earliest compositions, though I had
      only a basic understanding of music theory.
      <br />
      <br />&emsp; It was around this time that I fell in love with the soundtrack to one of my favorite games of all
      time: The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (Yes, really). The soaring orchestra and colorful tones introduced me to
      the wonders of video game music, and I dreamt of writing similar pieces. A fascination with music theory took hold
      of me during my freshman year of high school, and I started dedicating most of my free time to learning all that I
      could about how to properly compose pieces.
      <br />
      <br />&emsp; Around the time that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was coming out, I made one of my
      greatest discoveries: a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ClefferNotes"
        class="projectlink" target="_blank">ClefferNotes</a>. This artist had somehow created high quality orchestral
      pieces using a digital audio workstation instead of live musicians, and it fascinated me. It wasn't until next
      year that I would begin to try this out for myself, however. Later that year, I joined a project known as <a
        href="https://beyondskyrim.org/" class="projectlink" target="_blank">Beyond Skyrim</a>, a fanmade project that
      aims to modify The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Since then, I've spent countless hours refining my craft and learning
      to properly produce pieces rather than just compose them.
      <br />
      <br />&emsp; I'm still working on improving, and I don't think I'll ever stop trying to be the best composer I can
      be. In the midst of my college years as a BA in Music student at the <a href="https://music.unt.edu/"
        class="projectlink" target="_blank">University of North Texas</a>, I'm looking to the future and making plans
      for my life. I hope I can turn composing for video games and films into a career someday, and I'll do whatever I
      can to make this dream a reality.
